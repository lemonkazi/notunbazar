There is no evidence that ammonia is carcinogenic, although it has produced inflammatory lesions of the colon and caused cellular proliferation, which could increase susceptibility to malignant change (IPCS,1986). Ammonia is highly toxic for fish, and, because of its occurrence at high concentrations in some water systems, it can present a major pollution problem. It enters aquatic environments from several sources, including sewage effluent deposition of human wastes without treatment, industrial discharges, and runoff from agricultural operations. It is also a metabolic waste product of fish and, therefore, can be a problem in facilities involved with intensive fish culture (PCS, 1986). Ammonia toxicity data are listed in Table 4. As mentioned in Section 2.2.1.3, based on aquatic toxicity data, the weight percent of ammonia should not exceed 7 percent in a consumer product","","","","","","","","","2.0000","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1.0000","1","0.0000","1","1","","","1","1","1","0","1","0.0000","1","0","0","0","1","Glass Cleaner","0","simple","",""

RXSOL Liquid EWT treatment is an excellent treatment for diesel engine primary and secondary cooling water. It is also ideally suited for use in chilled water systems because it forms a clear, nonstaining solution, which protects the system from corrosion and hard water scale. Active Matter: 75-80 Packaging: 25.00 Ltr. Application: â€¢RXSOL Liquid EWT is very useful for Maintaining Nitrate In MIE,A/E & Compressor Fresh Water Cooling System. RXSOL Liquid EWT treatment is an effective corrosion inhibitor for ferrous metals in marine circulating cooling water systems. Because certain aluminum alloys are highly anodize, they may be difficult to completely protect. Therefore, the use of RXSOL liquid EWT treatment with systems containing aluminum alloys should be discussed with a local Rx Marine Marine representative prior to starting treatment. In order to ensure the maximum benefits from a RXSOL Liquid EWT treatment program, the system should be inspected for deposits and corrosion. If the system is found to be contaminated, it must be chemically cleaned before the treatment program begins. Dose: â€¢The system should be filled with good quality fresh or distilled water and where freeze protection is necessary, the proper amount of glycol-based antifreeze should be added. Begin circulating the system water, and add RXSOL Liquid EWT cooling water treatment at an initial dosage of 8 liters per ton of system water capacity.

Make the solution of Rxsol Latex Remover 4-10% with water for tank cleaning procedures. Allow product to soak for 20 minutes and flash down with fresh water. Same for circulation method where time for circulation could be between 1-3 hours. An additional circulation could be necessary when deposits of Latex are quite heavy . Spray RXSOL LATEX REMOVER at ambient temperature and allow approximately 20 minutes activation time. The latex can then be removed with cold water by means of high pressure. If necessary, repeat this treatment. 2. Ventilate, mop and dry the tank. Some minor dried latex residues which could be present on heating coils and pump body have to be removed manually.Recommended preparations before loading and discharge of Latex: Prepare the loading/discharge connection directly at the pump stack of the respective tank and flange off the line to the manifold. Install a valve at this connection and use hoses for the shore connection (necessary length should be as short as possible). Close the drop line inside the tank by a flange or alternatively with wooden plug.If a plug has to be used cover this with plastic foil (at least 3 layers) and fix it with a stainless steel band. For loading and discharge use the deep well pump only. All other connections and openings inside the tank should be dismantled, flanged off or protected as described above (e.g. steam, nitrogen,vapour line connections etc.).Fixed tank cleaning machines should be dismantled and blinder flanged. Tank dome hatches and Butter worth hatches including gaskets should be protected with a plastic foil which has to be placed between the dome and the hatch. Before loading steam the tank with very low pressure (1 bar) to make sure that the bulkheads, tank top, bottom and the lines inside the tank are humid but avoid any heat up. All equipment that might come into contact with the Latex should be washed with fresh water so they are humid before the loading takes place","","","","","","","","","2.0000","0.0000","1","0","0","1","1.0000","1","0.0000","1","1","","","1","1","1","0","1","0.0000","1","0","0","0","1","Latex Remover","0","simple","",""

Re-circulation Method
Fill tank with fresh water and heat up to warm 50 oC .IF a drop line is available on the tank line system, then start to circulate the water and add the required amount of Caustic flakes and LAC to make a 2.5% solution. A stronger solution can be made, but be advised that too much Caustic and too high temperature will result in white powder all over the tank. Under normal circumstances, between 2.5% and 4.5% will be sufficient strength. If there is no drop line, then lower butterworth hoses into the tank from the pump stack header without machines attached and circulate through these hoses while you fill the solution material.

7)Screen Printing Photography Chem
A potassium dichromate solution in sulfuric acidcan be used to produce a reversal negative (i.e., a positive transparency from a negative film). This is effected by developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silvermetal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed silver halide to be reduced to silver metal.Part N0:RXSOL-18-1016-025.

ORG - 191 t (Membrane Antiscalant) has shown for over 20 years excellent performance against the following scalants: calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, calcium fluoride, silica and iron.
Scaling and iron fouling of the RO membranes will reduce system performance and lead to premature membrane replacement. Precipitation of scale and deposits build up on the RO membrane, which leads to poor permeate quality, low permeate production, unscheduled downtime, increased water consumption and increased energy costs.
For RO units with a feedwater flowrate of 545m3/day (100 GPM) or less, the recommended product would be ORG - 191 t (Membrane Antiscalant) Part No. :  RXSOL-33-3321-030.

The latter is mainly organic and presents some peculiarities that will be explained forward (that will be further developed). Inorganic Silica Silica deposits are very hard, fragile and looks like/seem to porcelain. Precipitation of silicates is always related to the presence of iron or aluminum, forming silico-aluminates of calcium and iron. The cleaning of siliceous precipitates should be done in alkaline pH values and under temperatures as high as possible with detergent products. 
Aluminum The aluminum found in membranes might have three origins: ionic, colloidal (aluminum silicates) and an excess of coagulants (alumina sulfate and aluminum polychloride). As these coagulants are very difficult to clean, frequently high pH and temperatures are used in order to enhance the detergents’ action.
